Surface Plus is a collection of brep and nurbs surface utilities. The components range from simply exposing Rhinocommon curve commands, like blending, analysis, and offsetting, to new tools like grids, sub-surfacing, and iso-surfacing. These components integrate into existing Grasshopper Surface and Curve tabs.
